#USSD CODES FOR NAIJA

[View the app](https://tomiiide.github.io/ussdcodes/)

This simple react allows you to view and copy any all ussd codes of banks and telecom networks in Nigeria. It was built as a solution to the pain cause by having to google anytime i wanted to use USSD Banking on my phone, to also learn react.js and just have fun.
 

I hope you enjoy it and find it useful.
